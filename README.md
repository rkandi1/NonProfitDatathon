# NonProfitDatathon
DSC Datathon. Creating Database for Non-Profits.

## Mining the Data
For mining the data we used the database by [ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/116037894). We accessed the data using their [API](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/api) and scraping data from their original site. However we scraped data because another useful database was not available to us too much. [Guidestar](https://www.guidestar.org/) is a great database to use with regarding non-profits and will most probably work especially well with our algorihtm which uses Language processing to cluster non-profits. Their [API](https://apiportal.guidestar.org/) can retrieve data for mission statements and an organization's different stated goals.
